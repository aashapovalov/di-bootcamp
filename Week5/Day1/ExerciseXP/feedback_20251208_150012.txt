suggestions for improvement:
- The code should implement each exercise in a separate file or function to better organize the solutions.
- The HTML code provided is not a TypeScript solution to any of the exercises. It merely sets up an input field.
- The code doesn't align with the stated goals of creating TypeScript programs, defining types, control flow, and object manipulations.

suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 5, explicitly define the tuple type instead of using `object` as the return type. This is better for type safety.
- In Exercise 7, ensure the HTML element with the ID 'new-input' exists in the HTML to avoid potential runtime errors. Add a check before the type assertion.
- In Exercise 8, the `getAction` function only covers explicitly defined roles and does not satisfy the complex cases instruction.
