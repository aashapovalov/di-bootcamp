suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 4, the function signature should accept an array of `(number | string)[]` instead of separate `string[] | number[]` to align with the task's requirements of handling arrays with mixed types. the function `logLength<T extends {length: number}>(arg: T[]): number` doesn't return a value.
