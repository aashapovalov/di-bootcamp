suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding error handling to `getBookDetails` in case no book with the given ISBN is found. Currently, it returns `undefined` which might not be ideal.
- In the Library constructor, the books parameter should be private, not protected. Protected is only useful if other classes extend Library and need access to the books array.
- While technically correct, consider instantiating the DigitalLibrary with an initial empty array in the constructor. `super([])` clarifies that the base class Library is being initialized with an empty array of books. This enhances readability.
Correctness: 100%
