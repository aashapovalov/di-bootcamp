suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using more descriptive names for the filter values ('SHOW_ALL', 'SHOW_COMPLETED', 'SHOW_ACTIVE') in the reducer to improve code clarity.
- Add input validation to the edit task input to prevent XSS attacks

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only sets up the React application and ToDoProvider. It does not include the requested features of editing tasks, filtering tasks, using `useRef` for task editing, or implementing corresponding actions in the reducer. The core logic for the task manager enhancements is missing.

suggestions for improvement:
- This code sets up the context and reducer, but it doesn't implement the specific features requested in the instructions: editing tasks and filtering tasks by completion status. It only provides the context provider and a custom hook to access the context.
- The code needs to include the actual implementation of the task manager, including the UI, the logic for adding, editing, and filtering tasks, and the use of `useRef` for task editing.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding type checking or validation for the `action.payload` in the `EDIT_TODO` case to ensure data integrity.
- While the reducer logic is clear, adding comments to explain each case could further enhance readability, especially for complex applications.
