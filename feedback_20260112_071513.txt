suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using a more robust method for sanitizing HTML content to prevent potential XSS vulnerabilities, although this is a client-side application.
- The render function is called after every toggle/delete. While this works, consider more granular updates to the DOM for better performance, especially with a large number of recipes.
