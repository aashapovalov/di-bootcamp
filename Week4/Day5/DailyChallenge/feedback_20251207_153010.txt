suggestions for improvement:
- The provided HTML code sets up the basic structure of the currency converter, including the form elements for selecting currencies and inputting the amount, and also includes a link to an external javascript file named 'currency.js'. However, it doesn't include any actual JavaScript code demonstrating the use of Fetch API, async/await, or API calls to the ExchangeRate API. The javascript file should implement the logic to fetch currencies, handle conversions, and update the UI.
- You should make API calls to fetch currencies and exchange rates.
- Implement event listeners for the convert button and the switch button.
