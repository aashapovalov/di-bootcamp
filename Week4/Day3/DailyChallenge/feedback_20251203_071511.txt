suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only includes an HTML structure with a link to a JavaScript file (challenge.js). It doesn't contain any of the JavaScript code required to solve the daily challenges outlined in the chapter content.
- The missing JavaScript code should implement the `makeAllCaps`, `sortWords`, `toJs`, `toMorse`, and `joinWords` functions using Promises as specified.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using `Promise.all` in `makeAllCaps` for slightly improved performance if dealing with a very large array.
- While using `async/await` makes the code easier to read, the original instructions implied using explicit `Promise` construction. While not wrong, it's a slight deviation.
