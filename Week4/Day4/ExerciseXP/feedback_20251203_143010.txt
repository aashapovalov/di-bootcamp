- Exercise 2: The URL uses 'cat' instead of 'sun' as the search term, as instructed.
- Exercise 3: The solution for Exercise 3 doesn't extract and display objectStarWars.result as expected in the example output; it displays the entire data object.
- For better error handling, consider logging the error object itself instead of just a generic message.
