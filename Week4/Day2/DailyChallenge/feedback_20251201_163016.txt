suggestions for improvement:
- The provided HTML code only sets up the form structure and includes a script reference. The core logic for handling the form submission, retrieving data, and appending it as JSON to the DOM is missing.  This logic would normally be implemented in the `challenge.js` file, which isn't provided.
- The code lacks the JavaScript part which implements the main part of the instructions, specifically retrieving the form data and displaying it as a JSON string.
