suggestions for improvement:
- The `addToDo` reducer should update the state immutably using the spread operator instead of `concat`.  Concat does return a new array, but it is generally better to use the spread operator for consistency.
- The initial state can be defined directly within the `createSlice` function without pre-defining an empty array.
- Consider using more descriptive variable names (e.g., `todoId` instead of just `id` in action payloads) for improved readability.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider extracting the todo item rendering logic into a separate `TodoItem` component for better organization and reusability, as suggested in the instructions.
- Add more descriptive names for functions and variables to enhance readability.
