URL: https://github.com/aashapovalov/di-bootcamp/blob/main/Week6/Day4/ExerciseXP/app.js
suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding error handling, such as checking if the input array is empty or if the age property is missing from any person object, to avoid potential issues.
- The code is already quite readable, but adding a brief comment explaining the function's purpose could further improve clarity.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more robust error handling, though the current implementation is adequate.
- The `setupFiles` function can be simplified to reduce code duplication, but its current form is perfectly acceptable.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code is incomplete, it is missing the read-directory.js file.
- The code does not implement the second part of the excersice to read a directory.
- The code does not handle errors that may occur during file operations.
- The code lacks proper error handling for file operations, which could lead to unhandled exceptions and potential program crashes.
- The absence of comments makes it harder to understand the code's purpose and logic.

suggestions for improvement:
- This code only provides the data.js portion of Exercise 2. The complete solution requires creating an app.js file that imports this data, calculates the average age, and prints the result. The data.js file also needs an export statement.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is a `package-lock.json` file, which describes the dependencies of a Node.js project.  It doesn't actually implement any of the functionality described in the exercises.  It should contain the code from exercise 5.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided JSON appears to be the `package.json` file, which describes the project but does not contain the code for the `math.js` and `app.js` files as specified in Exercise 5. Therefore, it cannot be evaluated for correctness against the exercise's instructions.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided file appears to be a `package-lock.json` file, which is automatically generated by npm and isn't code written to fulfill exercise instructions.
- The exercise requires creating an `app.js` file that utilizes the chalk package to print colored output to the terminal. This submission only contains the package lock file.

- The provided code is a package.json file. While it relates to Exercise 6, it doesn't contain the app.js file with the chalk usage as requested in the prompt. The prompt specifically asks for a script that uses chalk to print a colorful message.

suggestions for improvement:
- Since there's no code provided for `todo.js`, it's impossible to determine if the implementation aligns with the exercise instructions.
- To improve, implement `todo.js` as an ES6 module exporting a `TodoList` class with methods to add tasks, mark tasks as complete, and list all tasks.
- Then, ensure `app.js` correctly imports and utilizes the `TodoList` class to perform the required operations.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding input validation to ensure task properties are of the correct type.
- The `markTask` method iterates through the entire list even after finding the task.  It could be optimized to break the loop once the task is found.
- The task object could be improved by having unique IDs instead of relying on 'number' property, which could be prone to errors if not managed correctly.
