suggestions for improvement:
- In the Customer table creation, specify 'id serial PRIMARY KEY' to automatically create a sequence and make it the primary key.
- The Customer Profile table is missing a constraint to ensure only one profile per customer. Consider adding a UNIQUE constraint on the customer_id column.
- Use boolean values (TRUE/FALSE) instead of string literals ('true'/'false') when inserting into the `is_logged_in` column.
- The number of customers not logged in can be calculated with a left join and counting the null `profile_id` records instead of filtering by customer_id.
- Part II is missing.

suggestions for improvement:
- Part I is completely missing. The submission only addresses Part II.
- Add PRIMARY KEY constraint to the junction table 'library' using the composite key (book_fk_id, student_id).
- Implement the constraint on the student's age to be not bigger than 15.
- Use subqueries to insert records into the library table.
- The borrowed date in the fourth insert statement in the library table is incorrect, it should be 2021-08-12, not 2021-12-08.
Correctness: 60%
