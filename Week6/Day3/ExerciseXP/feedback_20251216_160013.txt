suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding `NOT NULL` constraints to appropriate columns in the `customer_review` table (e.g., `language_id`, `title`, `score`, `review_text`).
- Use CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as default value for the last_update column in customer_review table.
- Add semicolon at the end of each SQL statement for consistency.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each query, especially for complex queries.
- For the 'boat' query, using `ilike '%boat%' or title ilike '%boat%'` might be more efficient than just checking the description.
