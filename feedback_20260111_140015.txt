suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding memoization to the `makeSelectBooksByGenre` factory function if performance becomes a concern with a very large number of books.
- Adding type definitions for the state and the return types of selectors enhances readability and maintainability.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using a more descriptive name for the `selectGenre` action, such as `setSelectedGenre` to improve clarity.
- The `default` case in the switch statement could explicitly return `selectBooks(state)` to enhance readability and avoid relying on the implicit `default` behavior.

suggestions for improvement:
- Implement `createSelector` to create selectors for filtering books based on genres (`selectBooks`, `selectHorrorBooks`, `selectFantasyBooks`, and `selectScienceFictionBooks`).
- The current slice only includes a reducer for `selectGenre` but lacks the selectors specified in the instructions.
- Consider using TypeScript's `Readonly` utility type for the `BookType` and `BookStateType` to ensure that the state is immutable.
- Add a dedicated folder for types to enhance project structure.
