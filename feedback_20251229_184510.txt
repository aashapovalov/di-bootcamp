suggestions for improvement:
- Consider moving the `fetchWebhook` function outside of the `App` component for better organization and to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Instead of hardcoding the `isError` variable in the `ShopScreen`, consider using a more dynamic approach, potentially based on user input or external data.

suggestions for improvement:
- This code only addresses Exercise 2. The other exercises are not implemented. Create components and functionality for React Router, Error Boundaries, and POST requests as described in the other exercises.
- For Exercise 2, ensure that the component is named `PostList.js` as specified in the instructions.
- Separate the component definition into its own file as specified in the instructions.
