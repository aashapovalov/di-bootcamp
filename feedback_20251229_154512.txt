suggestions for improvement:
- The component is well-structured and handles the form elements as described in the prompt.
- Consider adding more descriptive labels for accessibility.
- The instructions mention constructing the URL with the form data on submit. The code only defines the form, but doesn't handle the URL construction part.  This needs to be implemented within the `handleSubmit` function in the parent component (likely App.js) to fully address the problem description.
- The prompt specifies the exact URL structure to create `http://localhost:3000/?firstName=John&lastName=Doe&age=25&gender=male&destination=Japan&lactoseFree=on`. The provided component doesn't implement the submission logic to create such a URL.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using a more descriptive name for the `changeState` function to better reflect its purpose.
- The conversion of boolean values to 'on'/'off' strings might not be universally compatible. Consider alternative approaches if needed.
