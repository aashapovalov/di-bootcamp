suggestions for improvement:
- In Part I, the carInfo object should be created in App.js and then passed as props to the Car component.
- In Part II, the color state should be displayed along with the car model.
- In Part III, the Garage component is correctly used, but the size prop should be passed down from a parent component or defined dynamically if needed. You should define the Garage functional component in Garage.js. Make sure it renders the required text.
- Avoid hardcoding values like 'small' directly within the component if they are intended to be dynamic or passed from elsewhere.
