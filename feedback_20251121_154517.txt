suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the first loop `for(let i = 0; i < peopleCopy1.length; i++)` uses `peopleCopy1`, but it should be `peopleCopy`.  It is also not needed.
- In Exercise 3, the typeof check can be simplified by directly comparing `user_number` to `NaN` using `isNaN(user_number)`.
- In Exercise 6, the extra spaces in the `consoleString` are unnecessary.
