suggestions for improvement:
- Implement selectors for categories as well as tasks.  The instructions ask for `selectCategoryById`.
- Implement a selector to return tasks by a specific category, not just predefined categories. Implement `selectTasksByCategory` according to the instructions.
- Use memoization effectively to avoid unnecessary re-renders by only updating when necessary.
- Consider creating selectors for the categories themselves, not just tasks.

suggestions for improvement:
- Implement reducers for add, edit, and delete tasks and categories as requested in the instructions.
- Implement actions for add, edit, and delete tasks and categories as requested in the instructions.
- Create selectors as outlined in the instructions: `selectTasksByCategory`, `selectCompletedTasks`, and `selectCategoryById` using `createSelector`.
- Add task editing and completion functionality as outlined in the instructions, making use of useCallback for efficiency in handling task updates.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider implementing the `CategorySelector` component as a separate component as outlined in the instructions.
- Implement task editing and completion using `useCallback` as suggested.  Currently, there is no task editing or completion functionality.
- The selectors provided in the code are not using `createSelector`. Ensure that `createSelector` is used for memoization of derived data.
