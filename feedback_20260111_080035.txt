suggestions for improvement:
- Implement the `editTask` reducer action to align with the requirements of Step 2. Currently, there is no functionality to edit the tasks.
- The `removeToDo` reducer should properly update the state by assigning the filtered todos back to `state.todosByDay[day]`. Currently, it filters but doesn't update the state.
- The `toggleToDo` reducer should update the state by assigning the mapped todos back to `state.todosByDay[day]`. Currently, it maps but doesn't update the state.
- Consider adding a selector to extract todos for a specific day for better performance and encapsulation.

suggestions for improvement:
- Implement a proper date picker/calendar component as described in Step 3, instead of a simple text input for the day.
- Implement separate components for TaskList, AddTask, EditTask, and DeleteTask as outlined in Step 4.  The current code mixes all of this functionality into one component.
- Implement edit task functionality. The current code only covers adding, deleting, and toggling tasks.
- The selector should be more specific to avoid unnecessary re-renders. Selecting the entire state when only `state.todos` is needed can hurt performance as the application grows.
- Consider using more descriptive names for actions (e.g., `addTaskForDay` instead of just `addToDo`) to improve clarity.
- Add better error handling. For example, validate the date format.
