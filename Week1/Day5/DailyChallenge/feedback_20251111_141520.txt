suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each function and major code block.
- For better reusability, separate the input/output operations from the core logic of the `str_reverse` function.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements both challenges. It correctly sorts comma-separated words and finds the longest word in a sentence, as described in the Chapter Content/Questions. The example test cases provided in the prompt return the correct results.
- readability: The code is generally readable. Variable names are descriptive, and the logic is straightforward. However, adding comments could improve clarity, especially for those unfamiliar with the code.
- performance: The code's performance is adequate for the given tasks. The sorting and longest word finding algorithms are efficient enough for typical input sizes.
- security: The code doesn't appear to have any significant security vulnerabilities. Input is taken via the `input()` function, but there's no apparent risk of injection or other security issues in this context.
