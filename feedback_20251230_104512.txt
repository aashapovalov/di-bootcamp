suggestions for improvement:
- The server is missing the GET request to '/api/hello' as described in Part I. Implement this route to send the message 'Hello From Express'.
- Consider adding error handling to the POST route to gracefully handle cases where the request body is missing or invalid.

suggestions for improvement:
- The React app does not fetch the initial `/api/hello` message from the Express server and display it as a header as specified in Part I.  This is a major omission.
- The `console.log(inputMessage)` inside `handleChange` will log the *previous* value of `inputMessage` because state updates are not synchronous. This doesn't directly break functionality, but it's misleading.
- Consider using a more descriptive name than `url` for the endpoint in the `handleSubmit` function.
