suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using `requestAnimationFrame` for smoother animations instead of `setInterval`.  This is generally preferred for visual updates.
- Calculate the distance to move the box within the container instead of relying on a fixed duration (2000ms). This makes the animation adaptable to different container sizes.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using a single setInterval for Part III instead of two.  The controlInt setInterval is checking the paragraph count, and that logic can be combined into the addElement function.
- For Part III, the clearInt function is not being used and can be removed to reduce clutter.
