suggestions for improvement:
- In the makeBold function, it would be more precise to target only the paragraph elements within the article using document.querySelectorAll('article p') and then iterate through them to make each one bold. This avoids inadvertently bolding other elements within the article.
- For the bonus question involving hovering over the h1 element to change its font size, the event listener should be added in the script rather than directly in the HTML using onmouseenter.  Using addEventListener makes your JavaScript more maintainable and keeps your HTML cleaner.
