suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is only the HTML structure and doesn't contain the JavaScript logic to create the solar system. The javascript is referenced but not included
- You need to implement the javascript to create planets and moons

suggestions for improvement:
- The code doesn't address the bonus task of creating moons for each planet based on the number of moons each planet has.
- The last for loop attempts to iterate over `.planets`, but this class is never assigned. It should be `.planet` to select the created planets.
- Consider using a data structure like an array of objects to store planet names, colors, and the number of moons for each planet. This would make the code more organized and scalable.
- Handle the case where `planetColors` array might have fewer colors than planets. This could lead to an error if there are more planets than colors.
