suggestions for improvement:
- The code fulfills the main requirements: creating planet divs with different background colors and appending them to the section. However, the bonus part (creating moons) is not correctly implemented. The selector `.planets` is incorrect and it should be `.planet`. Also, the amount of moons is not considered.
- The `planetElements` variable is not used correctly. It's created after the planets, it is querying a class that doesn't exist, and its contents are not considered when adding moons.
