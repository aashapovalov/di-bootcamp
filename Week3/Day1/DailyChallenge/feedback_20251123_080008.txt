suggestions for improvement:
- The regex variable is defined but never used directly. Instead the match function is called with the same regular expression
- The sentence1 variable is defined but not declared using let, const, or var.
- Ensure the regular expression is properly escaped or constructed when used directly within the replace function to avoid unexpected behavior.
- Consider making the code more robust by handling cases where 'not' or 'bad' might not exist in the string more gracefully (e.g., providing a default value or using optional chaining).
