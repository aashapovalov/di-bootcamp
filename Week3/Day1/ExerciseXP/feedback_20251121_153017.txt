suggestions for improvement:
- The HTML file only sets up a basic structure to include a JavaScript file, but it doesn't contain any JavaScript code to address the exercises.  The actual JavaScript code should be included either directly within `<script>` tags or within the linked `exercise-gold.js` file. Ensure the javascript is inside the script tag.
