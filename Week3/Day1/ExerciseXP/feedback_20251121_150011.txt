- In Exercise 1, the problem asks to create a copy of the people array using the slice method, excluding "Mary" and the user's name. It would be better to create a new array using slice without modifying the original people array.
- In Exercise 3, the prompt is used twice. It would be more efficient to use only one prompt, placing it inside of the loop to ask the user a new number if the number is less than 10.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code provided is an HTML structure that links to a JavaScript file named 'exercise.js'.
- To properly assess and grade the code, I need to see the content inside the 'exercise.js' file, as the exercises require JavaScript code to implement various functionalities like array manipulation, loops, and object operations.
