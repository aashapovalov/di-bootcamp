suggestions for improvement:
- The submitted code does not address any of the exercises outlined in the chapter content. It presents solutions to different problems entirely unrelated to the provided instructions.
- The code covers array iteration, conditional statements and user prompts, but does not relate to array manipulations, loops, object property access, or for...in loops as instructed in the chapter exercises.

suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, Part I, the code modifies `peopleCopy1` which is initialized to `people`. This directly modifies the original `people` array, which is not the intended behavior. It should create a new array instead.
- In Exercise 1, Part II, the first loop does not need an else statement.
