suggestions for improvement:
- The HTML is incomplete. It lacks the structure for the color palette and the grid of squares.
- The Javascript file 'color-game.js' is not provided, so its functionality cannot be assessed.
- The HTML does not include any elements that the JavaScript could manipulate (e.g., divs for the color palette and the grid).

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider extracting the creation and styling of DOM elements into separate functions to improve readability and maintainability.
- While the code works, adding comments explaining the purpose of each major function or block of code will make it easier for others (and your future self) to understand.
