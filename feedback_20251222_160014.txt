suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using more descriptive variable names (e.g., instead of `state`, use something more specific like `quizState`).
- The `updateRound` middleware could be made more readable by extracting the conditional logic into a separate function.
- Improve error handling, especially when accessing `QUESTIONS` array to prevent out-of-bounds access.
- Ensure that the `QUESTIONS` array and the `state` object are properly initialized and managed to prevent unexpected behavior, especially in a multi-user environment.  Using a global state object may introduce concurrency issues.
- The commented-out code should be removed to improve readability and maintainability.
