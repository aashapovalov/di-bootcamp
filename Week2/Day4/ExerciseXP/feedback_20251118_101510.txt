suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the get_words_from_file function reads the file line by line, which is not ideal for a word list. Consider reading the entire file content and then splitting it into words using .split().
- In Exercise 2, the date format should be YYYY-MM-DD as per the instructions, not YYYY/MM/DD.
- In Exercise 2, printing the file content after writing to it within the 'with' block is unusual and unnecessary. Remove the lines 'f.seek(0)' and 'print(f.read())'.
Brief justification:
- correctness: Exercise 1 correctly implements the random sentence generator according to the instructions. Exercise 2 correctly parses the JSON, adds a key, and saves it to a file, but it has a minor error in the date format. Because of the minor date format error and an unnecessary file read in Exercise 2, the overall correctness is 70%.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The functions are named appropriately, and the comments explain the program's purpose.  Good use of whitespace and indentation enhances readability.
- performance: The code performs reasonably well for the given task. The random sentence generator is efficient enough for small sentence lengths. JSON operations are handled using Python's built-in library, which is generally efficient.
- security: The code doesn't involve any significant security risks. File handling is done with appropriate modes ('r' and 'w+'). The user input is validated in Exercise 1 to prevent excessively long sentences.
