suggestions for improvement:
- In `__init__`, the `current_idx` should be initialized to 0, as pages are indexed internally from 0, as stated in the instructions. You initialized it to 1.
- The calculation of `elem_end` in `get_visible_items` can be simplified and potentially corrected to prevent index out of bounds errors. Consider using `min(elem_begin + self.page_size, len(self.items))` for the end slice.
- The `first_page` and `last_page` methods do not return `self` for method chaining, as required by the instructions.
- The `next_page` and `previous_page` methods should return `self` for method chaining, as required by the instructions. Also, they currently print the exception message, rather than raising it as required in the `go_to_page` function.
- The code is missing the implementation of the `__str__` method, which is a required bonus task.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements the `Pagination` class with `__init__`, `get_visible_items`, `go_to_page`, `first_page`, `last_page`, `next_page`, and `previous_page` methods, addressing most of the requirements. However, `current_idx` is initialized incorrectly (should be 0), `elem_end` calculation in `get_visible_items` needs adjustment, `first_page` and `last_page` don't return `self`, exception handling in `next_page` and `previous_page` is incorrect, and the `__str__` method is missing. These deviations reduce the correctness score. The question asks to raise ValueError, the provided code prints the exception.
- readability: The code is generally readable, with clear variable names and structure. However, some comments could be added to clarify the purpose of certain calculations, particularly the slicing in `get_visible_items`.
- performance: The code's performance is acceptable for the given task. Slicing operations on lists are generally efficient.
- security: The code includes basic input validation in `go_to_page` to prevent invalid page numbers, enhancing security. However, no vulnerability detected.
