suggestions for improvement:
- The code does not implement the trivia quiz game as described in the instructions. It only sets up basic routes ('/' and '/about') without any quiz logic, question handling, or score tracking.
- It does not include the necessary routes for starting the quiz, submitting answers, or displaying the score (GET '/quiz', POST '/quiz', GET '/quiz/score').
- It does not use or define the 'triviaQuestions' array provided in the instructions.
- The code lacks the core functionality of a trivia quiz game.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code implements a basic To-Do API, which is completely unrelated to the trivia quiz game described in the chapter content. The focus of the exercise was to create a trivia quiz using Express.js and express.Router, including routes for starting the quiz, submitting answers, and displaying the score.
- The provided code does not address the core requirements of the chapter, such as handling quiz questions, tracking user scores, or providing feedback on answers.
- The code should be rewritten to implement the trivia quiz game logic, following the instructions outlined in the chapter content.
