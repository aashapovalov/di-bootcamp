suggestions for improvement:
- The code does not completely address any of the provided exercises.
- It lacks the implementation details for the routes and the specific CRUD operations for the to-do list or book management APIs.

URL: https://github.com/aashapovalov/di-bootcamp/blob/main/Week7/Day1/ExerciseXP/task1/package-lock.json
suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is a package-lock.json file, not the actual application code. This file alone does not fulfill any of the exercise instructions.  It merely records the versions of dependencies.
- To address the exercises, provide the actual app.js and routes/*.js files containing the Express application logic, route definitions, and CRUD operation implementations.

URL: https://github.com/aashapovalov/di-bootcamp/blob/main/Week7/Day1/ExerciseXP/task1/package.json
suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is a `package.json` file, which outlines project metadata and dependencies, but it doesn't represent the actual implementation of the Express.js application or the routing logic as described in exercises 1-3.
- The user must provide Javascript files to assess the correctness of the code.

URL: https://github.com/aashapovalov/di-bootcamp/blob/main/Week7/Day1/ExerciseXP/task1/routes/routes.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The code needs to be incorporated into a full Express application as described in Exercise 1 to be considered complete.
- Consider adding error handling for unexpected scenarios.
- Ensure proper input validation and sanitization to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

URL: https://github.com/aashapovalov/di-bootcamp/blob/main/Week7/Day1/ExerciseXP/task2/app.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The submission provides an `app.js` file that sets up a basic Express server and mounts a router. However, it does not include the contents of the `todo.js` file (or `index.js` for Exercise 1), where the actual route definitions and logic should reside as specified by the exercises. The provided code only sets up the server and mounts a router without implementing any of the specific routes mentioned in the exercises. Thus, the code is incomplete.

URL: https://github.com/aashapovalov/di-bootcamp/blob/main/Week7/Day1/ExerciseXP/task2/package-lock.json
suggestions for improvement:
- This code provides a `package-lock.json` file, which is not the expected deliverable for any of the exercises.
- The instructions call for creating JavaScript files (`app.js`, router modules) and implementing routes for Express.js applications.

URL: https://github.com/aashapovalov/di-bootcamp/blob/main/Week7/Day1/ExerciseXP/task2/package.json
suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code snippet is a package.json file, which defines the project's metadata and dependencies. It does not implement any of the exercises outlined in the chapter content, which involve creating Express.js applications with routes and API endpoints.
- The file lacks the actual implementation of the Express application, routes, and API logic required by the exercises.
- To address the exercises, the code should include JavaScript files (e.g., app.js, routes/index.js, routes/todos.js, routes/books.js) that define the Express application, routes, and API endpoints as described in the instructions.
Correctness: 0%

URL: https://github.com/aashapovalov/di-bootcamp/blob/main/Week7/Day1/ExerciseXP/task2/routes/todo.js
suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding error handling for unexpected issues during the PUT and DELETE operations.
- For enhanced security, consider using more robust validation and sanitization of input data to prevent potential injection attacks, especially when handling user-provided data like 'todoName'.

URL: https://github.com/aashapovalov/di-bootcamp/blob/main/Week7/Day1/ExerciseXP/task3/app.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The `router` import should specifically import the books router as defined in Exercise 3 instructions (e.g., `import booksRouter from './routes/books.js';`).
- The router should be mounted at the `/books` path instead of `/` to align with the testing instructions in Exercise 3 (e.g., `app.use('/books', booksRouter);`).
- The code is missing the implementation of the books router as given in the Exercise 3 instructions. You need to create `routes/books.js` file that include CRUD operations.

URL: https://github.com/aashapovalov/di-bootcamp/blob/main/Week7/Day1/ExerciseXP/task3/package-lock.json
suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is a `package-lock.json` file, which is automatically generated by npm and shouldn't be submitted as the solution to the exercises.
- The exercises require creating an Express.js application, defining routes using `express.Router()`, and implementing API endpoints for managing data (to-do list and books).
- The `package-lock.json` file just specifies the versions of the installed dependencies. It does not contain the application logic or route definitions.

URL: https://github.com/aashapovalov/di-bootcamp/blob/main/Week7/Day1/ExerciseXP/task3/package.json
suggestions for improvement:
- The submission only contains the package.json file. It's missing app.js and the routes directory with the books.js file, including the code implementing the Express application and the API routes for the book management system as described in Exercise 3.
- The instructions in Exercise 3 specifically request creating an `app.js` file to set up the Express application and a `routes/books.js` file to define the routes for managing books.
Correctness: 0%

URL: https://github.com/aashapovalov/di-bootcamp/blob/main/Week7/Day1/ExerciseXP/task3/routes/books.js
suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding error handling for invalid JSON payloads in POST and PUT requests.
- Implement validation for the bookTitle to prevent empty or excessively long titles.
- Use more descriptive variable names for better readability (e.g., newBookTitle instead of title in the PUT route).
- Consider using a more robust database solution for persistence instead of an in-memory array.
